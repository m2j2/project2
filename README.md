M2J2 - MyIIT Project

Martae (myself) - Created the initial makeup of site, with design and structure. Provided the registration page. Assisted partners with suggestions to solve issues with code and design.
Jaina Parekh - Foundation of the team. Created most, if not all, of the JavaScript capabilities of the site. Dependable to come to meetings and get work done.
Jessica Soto - Created the page to Add/Drop classes. Very optimistic mindset, always made sure that we put our best foot forward. Dependable to meet to collaborate.
Maa Osei - Great team moderator. Always made sure we had a meeting spot and a plan for the project. Created a lot of the initial design of pages, as she created the first page for the site.
