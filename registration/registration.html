              <summary>STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY</summary>
              <p> Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) is providing you this information to help you understand the commitment that you are making with respect to the payment of your tuition, fees and other costs during your terms of enrollment at IIT, and by clicking the box below and proceeding to register for courses at IIT, you are acknowledging that you have received, read and understood this information and agreed to the terms and conditions that it contains.</p>
              <ol>  
                <li>Your student account includes charges and credits assessed to you during your enrollment at IIT, including, without limitation, tuition, room, board, fees, expenses, health insurance premiums, financial aid credits and adjustments, payments made to your account, service charges for late payment, and various fines. You may view your student account at any time through the myIIT portal.</li>
                <li>Each semester, a billing statement will be made available to you through the myIIT portal and such other responsible party or parties that you designate (e.g., parent or guardian) and for whom you have provided IIT with an e-mail address. This statement will detail the then-current charges, payments and other credits to your account, including the amount you must pay and the date such payment is due. Notifications of new billing statements will be sent via email to your IIT email address as well as the e-mail for any other responsible party that you had designated. You agree to monitor your IIT email account regularly.</li>
                <li>If your financial aid, including any disbursements of Title IV funds such as Pell grants or Federal loans, creates a credit balance on your student account, you will be refunded any such overage. If any non-financial aid payments that you make results in an overpayment of the charges on your account, IIT will hold these credits on your student account to be applied towards future charges, unless you contact the Student Accounting Office to request a refund of the overpayment, or you cease to be enrolled.</li>
                <li>By clicking the box below and proceeding to register for classes, you promise to take financial responsibility for the payment of all your education related charges and fees that become a part of your student account, when those charges are due regardless of your expected reliance on third-party resources such as financial aid, family gifts, employer reimbursement, private loans, outside scholarship or sponsorships. Any balance due to IIT as the result of adjustments made to your estimated or confirmed financial aid or your refusal to apply for any or all of your financial aid or your inability to complete the financial aid verification become your responsibility for payment. You agree to supply the Financial Aid Office with any reasonable information or documents that they may request to complete the verification process in a timely manner.</li>
                <li>By clicking the box below and proceeding to register for classes, you acknowledge that any outstanding balance due on your student account that is not timely paid when due is subject to service charges in the amounts or at the rates established and published by IIT from time to time and that you will be prevented from registering for additional courses at IIT or obtaining official documents such as diplomas or transcripts until that outstanding balance has been paid in full. You also acknowledge that failure to pay any amount due by the due date may result in an unfavorable report with credit bureaus and collection activities against you, including litigation. You agree to pay the actual expenses incurred in connection with collection of the debt, including but not limited to attorney fees, and you also agree to reimburse IIT the fees of any collection agency, which may be based on a percentage at a maximum of 33% of the aggregate amount of the debt.</li>
